## Bootstrap Actions Explained

All examples use bootstrap actions to automate deployment tasks. Here's the standard pattern:

```yaml
bootstrap:
  actions:
    # 1. Create connections (if needed)
    - type: datazone.create_connection
      name: mlflow-server
      connection_type: MLFLOW
      properties:
        trackingServerArn: arn:aws:sagemaker:${STS_REGION}:${STS_ACCOUNT_ID}:mlflow-tracking-server/name
    
    # 2. Create workflows (REQUIRED)
    - type: workflow.create
      workflowName: my_workflow
    
    # 3. Run workflows
    - type: workflow.run
      workflowName: my_workflow
      trailLogs: true  # Stream logs during deployment
    
    # 4. Additional actions
    - type: quicksight.refresh_dataset
      refreshScope: IMPORTED
```

**Why this order matters:**
1. **Connections first**: Workflows may reference connections (like MLflow)
2. **Create before run**: Workflows must exist before they can be executed
3. **Trail logs**: `trailLogs: true` provides real-time feedback during deployment

See [Bootstrap Actions Guide](bootstrap-actions.md) for complete documentation.
