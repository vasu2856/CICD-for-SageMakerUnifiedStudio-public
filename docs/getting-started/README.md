**Set up CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure**

You're responsible for configuring CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), managing SageMaker Unified Studio projects, and setting up infrastructure for data teams.

→ **[Admin Quick Start](admin-quickstart.md)** (15-20 minutes)

**What you'll learn:**
- Create projects for dev/test/prod
- Configure connections and resources
- Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
- Manage team access
- Configure monitoring and alerts
- Control infrastructure templates
