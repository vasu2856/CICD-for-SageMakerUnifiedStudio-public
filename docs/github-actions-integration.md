```

## Infrastructure Setup Requirements

### AWS Prerequisites

Before setting up CI/CD integration, ensure you have the necessary AWS infrastructure and permissions:

#### 1. AWS Account Setup
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- SageMaker Unified Studio enabled in target regions
- DataZone service activated (if using catalog assets)

#### 2. IAM Roles and Permissions

Create IAM roles for CI/CD with these minimum permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sagemaker:*",
        "datazone:*",
        "mwaa:*",
        "s3:*",
        "cloudformation:*",
        "iam:PassRole",
        "iam:GetRole",
        "iam:CreateRole",
        "iam:AttachRolePolicy"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. OIDC Provider Setup (GitHub Actions)

Use the provided CloudFormation template:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file tests/scripts/setup/1-account-setup/github-oidc-role.yaml \
  --stack-name smus-cli-github-integration \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --parameter-overrides \
    GitHubOrg=your-org \
    GitHubRepo=your-repo \
    GitHubEnvironment=aws-env
```

**For detailed setup:** See [Admin Quick Start](getting-started/admin-quickstart.md#step-8-set-up-cicd-authentication-optional)

> **⚠️ TODO:** Document minimum required IAM permissions.

### Environment Separation

#### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Development and testing deployments
- **AWS Role**: Broader permissions for experimentation
- **Protection Rules**: None (automatic deployment)
- **Resources**: Development domains, test projects

#### Production Environment  
- **Purpose**: Production deployments
- **AWS Role**: Restricted permissions, production-only access
- **Protection Rules**: Required reviewers, manual approval
- **Resources**: Production domains, live projects

## CLI Infrastructure Management

### Automatic Infrastructure Creation

The SMUS CI/CD CLI intelligently manages infrastructure creation and updates:

#### **Idempotent Operations**
- **Safe Re-runs**: CLI detects existing resources and skips creation
- **No Duplicates**: Won't create domains, projects, or environments that already exist
- **Consistent State**: Ensures infrastructure matches bundle configuration

#### **Domain Management**
```bash
# CLI automatically creates DataZone domain if missing
aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --stages test
# Creates domain "my-studio-domain" if it doesn't exist
# Uses existing domain if already present
```

#### **Project Creation**
```bash
# CLI creates SageMaker projects as needed
aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --stages test,prod
# Creates "my-project-test" and "my-project-prod" projects
# Skips creation if projects already exist
```

#### **Environment Provisioning**
- **Lakehouse Environments**: Automatically provisioned for data access
- **MWAA Environments**: Created for Airflow workflow execution  
- **Connections**: Established between projects and environments
- **Permissions**: Proper IAM roles and policies applied

#### **Benefits of Automatic Infrastructure**
- **Reduced Setup Time**: No manual infrastructure preparation required
- **Consistency**: Infrastructure matches bundle configuration exactly
- **Error Prevention**: Eliminates manual configuration mistakes
- **Team Onboarding**: New team members can deploy immediately

### Infrastructure Detection Logic

The CLI uses intelligent detection to determine what needs to be created:

1. **Domain Resolution**: Looks up domain by name, creates if missing
2. **Project Validation**: Checks project existence, creates with proper configuration
3. **Environment Assessment**: Validates required environments, provisions as needed
4. **Connection Verification**: Ensures proper connectivity between components

## CI/CD Environment Configuration

### GitHub Environments

Configure different GitHub environments for deployment stages:

#### Development Environment (`aws-env`)
```yaml
# Repository Settings → Environments → aws-env
Protection Rules: None
Secrets:
  AWS_ROLE_ARN: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/GitHubActions-Dev
Variables:
  AWS_REGION: us-east-1
  DOMAIN_REGION: us-east-1
```

#### Production Environment (`aws-env-prod`)
```yaml
# Repository Settings → Environments → aws-env-prod  
Protection Rules:
  - Required reviewers: 2
  - Wait timer: 5 minutes
  - Deployment branches: main only
Secrets:
  AWS_ROLE_ARN: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/GitHubActions-Prod
Variables:
  AWS_REGION: us-west-2
  DOMAIN_REGION: us-west-2
```

### Secrets Management

#### Required Secrets
- `AWS_ROLE_ARN`: IAM role for AWS authentication
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Alternative to OIDC (less secure)
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Alternative to OIDC (less secure)

#### Environment Variables
- `AWS_REGION`: Target AWS region
- `DOMAIN_NAME`: SageMaker Unified Studio domain name
- `PROJECT_PREFIX`: Prefix for project naming

### Branch Protection Rules

Configure branch protection to ensure code quality:

```yaml
# Repository Settings → Branches → main
Branch Protection Rules:
  - Require pull request reviews
  - Require status checks to pass
  - Require branches to be up to date
  - Restrict pushes to matching branches
```

## Pipeline Stages and Workflow

### Stage Progression

The SMUS CI/CD CLI supports a standard deployment progression with automatic infrastructure management:

#### **Development → Test → Production Flow**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Development Environment] --> B[Create Bundle]
    B --> C[Deploy to Test]
    C --> D[Run Tests]
    D --> E{Tests Pass?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Manual Approval Gate]
    E -->|No| G[Fix Issues]
    G --> A
    F --> H[Deploy to Production]
    H --> I[Production Validation]
    I --> J[Monitor & Alert]
```

### Bundle Creation and Management

#### **Bundle Creation Process**
```bash
# CLI packages all deployment artifacts
aws-smus-cicd-cli bundle --manifest manifest.yaml --targets test
```

**What gets bundled:**
- Airflow DAGs and dependencies
- Jupyter notebooks and scripts
- Configuration files and schemas
- DataZone catalog asset references
- Environment-specific parameters

#### **Artifact Management**
- **S3 Storage**: Bundles uploaded to environment-specific S3 buckets
- **Versioning**: Each bundle tagged with commit SHA or version
- **Reuse**: Same bundle deployed across test → production
- **Rollback**: Previous bundles available for quick rollback

### Infrastructure-Aware Deployment

#### **Automatic Infrastructure Provisioning**

The CLI handles infrastructure creation during deployment:

```bash
# Single command creates all required infrastructure
aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --stages test

# CLI automatically:
# 1. Creates DataZone domain if missing
# 2. Creates SageMaker project if missing  
# 3. Provisions required environments (Lakehouse, MWAA)
# 4. Establishes connections between components
# 5. Deploys bundle to target environment
```

#### **Infrastructure Detection Logic**
1. **Domain Resolution**: Resolves domain by name, creates if not found
2. **Project Validation**: Checks project existence, creates with proper settings
3. **Environment Assessment**: Validates environments, provisions missing ones
4. **Connection Setup**: Ensures proper connectivity and permissions

#### **Idempotent Operations**
- **Safe Re-runs**: Multiple deployments won't create duplicate resources
- **State Consistency**: Infrastructure matches bundle configuration
- **Error Recovery**: Failed deployments can be safely retried

### Catalog Asset Integration

#### **Automatic Subscription Management**

The CLI handles DataZone catalog asset access throughout the pipeline:

```yaml
# In manifest.yaml - catalog assets are automatically managed
content:
  catalog:
    assets:
      - selector:
          search:
            assetType: GlueTable
            identifier: covid19_db.countries_aggregated
        permission: READ
        requestReason: Required for pipeline deployment
```

**CLI Automation:**
1. **Asset Discovery**: Identifies required catalog assets in bundle
2. **Subscription Requests**: Creates subscription requests for target project
3. **Approval Workflow**: Manages approval process with configurable timeout
4. **Grant Verification**: Ensures access is granted before proceeding
5. **Cross-Environment**: Handles different subscriptions per environment

### Manual Approval Gates

#### **Production Deployment Protection**

Configure manual approval for production deployments using CI/CD platform features:

**GitHub Actions Example:**
```yaml
deploy-production:
  name: "Deploy to Production"
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: aws-env-prod  # Triggers manual approval
  needs: [test-validation]
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to Production
      run: |
        aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --stages prod
```

**GitLab CI Example:**
```yaml
deploy-production:
  stage: deploy
  environment:
    name: production
    action: start
  when: manual  # Requires manual trigger
  script:
    - aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --stages prod
```

#### **Approval Workflow Process**

1. **Workflow Pause**: CI/CD pipeline pauses at production deployment
2. **Notification**: Designated reviewers receive notification
3. **Review Process**: Reviewers can:
   - ✅ **Approve**: Continue to production deployment
   - ❌ **Reject**: Stop the workflow with reason
   - 💬 **Comment**: Request changes or clarification
4. **Audit Trail**: All approvals logged for compliance
5. **Deployment**: Approved deployments proceed automatically

### CLI Integration Points

#### **1. Configuration Validation**
```bash
# Validates bundle configuration and connectivity
aws-smus-cicd-cli describe --manifest manifest.yaml --connect
```

#### **2. Bundle Creation**
```bash
# Creates deployment bundle from source environment
aws-smus-cicd-cli bundle --manifest manifest.yaml --targets test
```

#### **3. Infrastructure-Aware Deployment**
```bash
# Deploys with automatic infrastructure creation
aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --stages test
```

#### **4. Test Execution**
```bash
# Runs validation tests on deployed environment
aws-smus-cicd-cli test --manifest manifest.yaml --stages test
```

#### **5. Production Deployment**
```bash
# Deploys to production with approval gates
aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --stages prod
```

#### **6. Monitoring and Status**
```bash
# Monitors deployment status and health
aws-smus-cicd-cli monitor --manifest manifest.yaml --stages prod
```

## Manual Reviewers and Approval Process

### Setting Up Approval Gates

#### **GitHub Environment Protection Rules**

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**
   - Go to **Settings** → **Environments**
   - Select or create production environment

2. **Configure Protection Rules**
   ```yaml
   Environment: aws-env-prod
   Protection Rules:
     - Required reviewers: 2-3 team members
     - Wait timer: 5-10 minutes (optional)
     - Deployment branches: main, release/* only
     - Prevent self-review: enabled
   ```

3. **Reviewer Assignment**
   - **Team Leads**: Senior developers or architects
   - **DevOps Engineers**: Infrastructure and deployment experts  
   - **Product Owners**: Business stakeholders for critical releases
   - **Security Team**: For compliance-sensitive deployments

#### **GitLab Environment Protection**

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
deploy-production:
  stage: deploy
  environment:
    name: production
    deployment_tier: production
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
      when: manual
      allow_failure: false
  script:
    - aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --stages prod
```

### Approval Workflow Mechanics

#### **Notification Process**
1. **Automatic Alerts**: Reviewers notified via email/Slack when approval needed
2. **Context Information**: Deployment details, changes, and test results provided
3. **Review Dashboard**: Centralized view of pending approvals

#### **Review Criteria**
- **Code Quality**: All tests passing, code review completed
- **Security Validation**: Security scans passed, no vulnerabilities
- **Business Impact**: Change aligns with business requirements
- **Rollback Plan**: Clear rollback strategy documented

#### **Approval Actions**
```yaml
# Reviewer options in GitHub/GitLab UI
Actions Available:
  - Approve Deployment: ✅ Proceed with production deployment
  - Request Changes: 🔄 Block deployment, request modifications  
  - Reject Deployment: ❌ Stop deployment with reason
  - Add Comments: 💬 Provide feedback or ask questions
```

### Audit Trail and Compliance

#### **Deployment History**
- **Who**: User who initiated deployment
- **What**: Changes being deployed (commit SHA, bundle version)
- **When**: Timestamp of deployment request and approval
- **Why**: Deployment reason and business justification
- **Reviewers**: Who approved/rejected with comments

#### **Compliance Features**
- **SOX Compliance**: Separation of duties between developers and approvers
- **Change Management**: Integration with ITSM tools for change requests
- **Audit Logs**: Immutable logs of all deployment activities
- **Rollback Tracking**: Complete history of rollbacks and reasons

## Specific Implementation Example: aws/CICD-for-SageMakerUnifiedStudio

This section demonstrates how the general concepts above are implemented in the specific GitHub repository `https://github.com/aws/CICD-for-SageMakerUnifiedStudio/` using the `.github/workflows/full-pipeline-lifecycle.yml` workflow.

### Repository-Specific Configuration

#### **GitHub Environments Used**
- **`aws-env`**: Development environment for testing and validation
- **`aws-env-amirbo-6778`**: Production environment with manual approval gates

#### **Multi-Environment AWS Role Configuration**
```yaml
# Development Role (broader permissions for testing)
- name: Configure AWS credentials (Dev)
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    aws-region: us-east-1
    role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN_DEV }}
    role-session-name: smus-pipeline-lifecycle-dev
    role-duration-seconds: 43200

# Production Role (restricted permissions)  
- name: Configure AWS credentials (Prod)
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    aws-region: us-east-1
    role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN_PROD }}
    role-session-name: smus-pipeline-lifecycle-prod
    role-duration-seconds: 43200
```

### Workflow Implementation Details

The `full-pipeline-lifecycle.yml` workflow demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline with the following jobs:

#### **Job 1: Setup and Environment Resolution**
```yaml
setup:
  name: "Step 1 - Setup and Resolve Environment"
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: aws-env
  outputs:
    domain-id: ${{ steps.resolve.outputs.domain-id }}
    project-id: ${{ steps.resolve.outputs.project-id }}
```

**Purpose**: Resolves DataZone domain and project IDs from user-friendly names
**Infrastructure Management**: CLI automatically detects existing domains or creates them if missing

#### **Job 2: Bundle Creation**
```yaml
create-bundle:
  name: "Step 2 - Create Bundle"
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: aws-env
  needs: setup
```

**Purpose**: Packages deployment artifacts including DAGs, notebooks, and catalog assets
**CLI Command**: `aws-smus-cicd-cli bundle --manifest manifest.yaml --targets test`
**Infrastructure Impact**: Creates S3 storage for bundles if not present

#### **Job 3: Test Environment Deployment**
```yaml
deploy-test:
  name: "Step 3 - Deploy to Test Environment"
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: aws-env
  needs: [setup, create-bundle]
```

**Purpose**: Deploys to test environment with automatic infrastructure provisioning
**CLI Command**: `aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --stages test`
**Infrastructure Created**:
- SageMaker project (if missing)
- Lakehouse environment (if missing)
- MWAA environment (if missing)
- Required IAM roles and policies

#### **Job 4: Test Execution**
```yaml
run-tests:
  name: "Step 4 - Run Tests on Test Environment"
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: aws-env
  needs: [setup, create-bundle, deploy-test]
```

**Purpose**: Validates deployment through automated testing
**CLI Command**: `aws-smus-cicd-cli test --manifest manifest.yaml --stages test`

#### **Job 5: Production Deployment (Manual Approval)**
```yaml
deploy-prod:
  name: "Step 5 - Deploy to Production Environment"
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: aws-env-amirbo-6778  # Triggers manual approval
  needs: [setup, create-bundle, deploy-test, run-tests]
```

**Manual Approval Gate**: Uses GitHub environment `aws-env-amirbo-6778` with protection rules
**CLI Command**: `aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --stages prod`
**Infrastructure Management**: Creates production infrastructure idempotently

### Repository-Specific Features

```

### Security Implementation

#### **OIDC Integration**
The repository uses AWS OIDC for secure authentication without long-lived credentials:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
```

#### **Environment Protection Rules**
- **Development (`aws-env`)**: No protection, automatic deployment
- **Production (`aws-env-amirbo-6778`)**: 
  - Required reviewers: 2 team members
  - Manual approval required
  - Deployment branch restrictions

### Catalog Asset Integration Example

The workflow demonstrates automatic catalog asset management:

```yaml
# CLI automatically handles catalog asset subscriptions
- name: Deploy with Catalog Assets
  run: |
    aws-smus-cicd-cli deploy --manifest manifest.yaml --stages prod
    # CLI automatically:
    # 1. Identifies catalog assets in bundle
    # 2. Requests subscriptions for production project
    # 3. Waits for approval (with timeout)
    # 4. Verifies grants before proceeding
```

### Monitoring and Cleanup

#### **Pipeline Monitoring**
```yaml
monitor-pipeline:
  name: "Step 6 - Monitor Pipeline Status"
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: aws-env-amirbo-6778
  needs: [deploy-prod]
```

#### **Automatic Cleanup**
```yaml
cleanup:
  name: "Step 7 - Cleanup Test Resources"
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: aws-env
  if: always()  # Runs even if previous jobs fail
```

### Repository Setup for This Implementation

#### **Required Secrets**
```bash
# Repository Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions
AWS_ROLE_ARN_DEV = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GitHubActions-Dev
AWS_ROLE_ARN_PROD = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GitHubActions-Prod
```

#### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Environment: aws-env
DEV_DOMAIN_REGION = us-east-1

# Environment: aws-env-amirbo-6778  
PROD_DOMAIN_REGION = us-east-2
```

#### **GitHub Environment Configuration**
